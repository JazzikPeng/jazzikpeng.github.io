# How to build a good Rec System
I have worked at TikTok for two year and half in video recommendation system. TikTok has one of the best recommendation system in the world. I have learned a lot from my colleagues and I want to share my knowledge with you. I want to break down this series in 11 posts:
1. Major Component in Rec System
2. Modeling Target
3. Training Data
4. Loss Optimization
5. Feature Engineering
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Model Structure
8. Reinforcement Learning in Rec System
9. Federated Learning in Rec System
10. AutoML and Application in Rec System
11. Other
