#### What do we hope to learn?
- RNN

- Attention

- PyTorch

- Word meaning, dependency parsing, machine translation, question answering

 

Traditional NLP use **one-hot** encoding for words.
The problem is that the one-hot matrix can be very big.
There is no natural notion of similarity of one-hot vectors because they are orthogonal.

We can use a word similarity tabl, yet the table will be very large (500,000 words X 500,000 words)!

#### Denotational Semantics VS. Distributional Semantics

- Denotational Semantics: signifier (symbol) ‚ü∫ signified (idea or thing)

- Distributional Semantics: A word's meaning is given by the words that frequently appear close-by


#### Word2vec
Idea:

1. We have a large corpus of text

2. Every word in a fixed vocabulary is represented by a **vector**

3. Go through each position t in the text, which has a center word c and context ("outside") words o

4. Use the **similarity of the word vectors** for c and o to calculate the probability of o given c (or vice versa)

5. **Keep adjusting the word vectors** to maximize this probability
